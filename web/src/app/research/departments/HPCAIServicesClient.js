            UTCN has designed, within AIRi@UTCN, a computing infrastructure consisting of 32 GPU Node
            servers (each with 8 GPUs), along with control servers, storage, and networking equipment, arranged
            in up to 6 racks with cooling based on RDHx (Rear Door Heat Exchanger) and DLC (Direct Liquid
            Cooling).
